# single-fiber-PoE-media-converter
Discover single fiber media converters designed for government and PoE applications. From secure public sector networks to PoE+ powered devices, these WDM converters maximize fiber efficiency and extend Ethernet over a single optical strand.

# Single Fiber Media Converters for Government & Power-Enabled Networks

Single fiber media converters optimize fiber usage by transmitting and receiving data over a single optical strand using WDM technology. When combined with power features like PoE/PoE+, they enable cost-effective, space-saving connectivity â€” especially in government, public infrastructure, and surveillance applications.

## Government-Grade Connectivity

**Single fiber government media converters** are purpose-built for public institutions such as city halls, law enforcement offices, and municipal buildings. These converters offer secure, efficient network extension where fiber resources are limited but reliability is critical.

## Power Over Fiber: PoE & PoE+ Integration

- **Single fiber PoE media converters** transmit Ethernet data and provide Power over Ethernet on the same line, allowing remote powering of IP cameras, wireless APs, or access control devices over a single fiber strand.

- **Single fiber PoE+ media converters** extend this capability to support higher power devices such as PTZ cameras, high-power sensors, or smart displays, delivering up to 30W per port.

## Versatile Ethernet Extension

- A **single fiber Ethernet media converter** enables point-to-point Ethernet extension using only one strand of fiber, ideal for environments where infrastructure is constrained or expansion is needed without trenching for additional fiber.

- The **single fiber optical media converter** ensures long-distance, full-duplex data transfer across diverse applications such as government surveillance, smart city infrastructure, and education networks.
